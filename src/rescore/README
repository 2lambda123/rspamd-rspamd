CORPUS TESTING

Run corpus-test.py to test emails and generate log.

Example:

	./corpus-test.py --ham test-ham --spam test-spam -o test.log

Use ./corpus-test.py -h to get more info about usage.

Log file consists of one line per email. It contains filename, actual email type, score, action, symbols in that order.


TESTING SETTINGS

"test.conf" file is used as default config file corpus-testing. If you would like to use a custom config file, use -c option.

NOTE: Enclose the value for settings in triple quotes

Example 'test.conf' for disabled symbol group "encryption":

	{
		"Settings" : '''{groups_disabled=["encryption"]}'''
	}



NOTE: You might encounter shutdown exception at times. This is a known python 2.7 error. However, it doesnt affect the results.

STATISTICS

Use statistics.py to infer useful information from the log file generated in previous step. For generating statistics specify spam threshold score using -t. Feed in log file using input redirection.

Example:

	./statistics.py -t 10 < test.log > stats.log

Use ./statistics.py -h to get more info about usage

Statistics contains two different information - File stats and symbol stats.

File stats:

Number of emails: Number of emails read from log
Number of spam: Number of spam emails read from log
Number of ham: Number of ham emails read from log
Spam percentage: Percentage of spam emails read from log
Ham percentage: Percentage of ham emails read from log
False positive rate: Percentage of ham emails that were falsely classified as spam
False negative rate: Percentage of spam emails that were falsely classified as ham

Symbol stats:

Each line presents statistics about a symbol read from the log.

Overall  : % of emails hit by a symbol
Spam %   : % of spam emails hit by a symbol
Ham %    : % of ham emails hit by a symbol
S/O      : % spam emails hit over all its hits
	   (i.e What is the probability that it hits a spam message when it is fired)
